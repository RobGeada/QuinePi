# QuinePi

This quick little program generates a valid Python QuinePi; a program that estimates pi by computing the area of its own source code.

By typing `python genQuine.py <radius>`, a QuinePi program of radius r will be generated and run. I've included an [example generated program](https://github.com/RobGeada/QuinePi/blob/master/quinePi.py) of radius 14, the smallest one I've managed to get working correctly thus far.
