# QuinePi

This quick little program generates a valid python script that generates a QuinePi; a program that estimates pi by computing the area of its own source code.

By typing `python genQuine.py <radius>`, a QuinePi program of radius r will be generated and run. I've included an example generated program of radius 14, the smallest one I've managed to get working correctly thus far.
