# QuinePi

This quick little program generates a valid python script that estimates pi by computing its own area; or a QuinePi, as I've taken to calling it. Essentially, a QuinePi reads itself, and uses the area of its source code to estimate pi.

By typing `python genQuine.py <radius>`, a QuinePi program of radius r will be generated and run. I've included an example generated program of radius 14, the smallest one I've managed to get working correctly thus far.
