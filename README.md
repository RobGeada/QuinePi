# QuinePi

This quick little program generates a valid Python QuinePi; a program that estimates pi by computing the area of its own source code.

By typing `python genQuine.py <flag> <radius>`, a QuinePi program of radius r will be generated and run. I've included an [example](https://github.com/RobGeada/QuinePi/blob/master/quinePi.py) QuinePi of radius 12, the smallest one I've managed to get working correctly thus far.

Using the `-v` flag will print the generated program, while the `-q` flag will hide that output.
